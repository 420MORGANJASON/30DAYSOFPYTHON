This is an open-source project guide for learning Python Programming Language .

Fork it and create separate branches/folders for each day. 

## Topics Breakdown

### Day 1: Python Basics
Start by installing Python and a text editor. Learn the basics of Python, such as: 
 variables, data types, Math Operators, Comments, Input() function, Print() function, The str(), int(), and float() Functions

#### Exercise
Simple Python Calculator Program: Write a simple program that does basic math operations including addition, subtraction, deletion, division, power, squareroot,etc,.

Learn how to use control flow statements like if-else statements, Switch-Case Statement,Logical Operators (and, OR), Boolean operators and comparisonooperations such as <, >, !==, ==, etc

#### Exercise
You are building a program to help a user decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the current temperature in Fahrenheit and whether it is currently raining or not (as a boolean value), and then suggests an appropriate outfit based on the following criteria:

If the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit, suggest wearing a coat, hat, scarf, and gloves.

If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a rain jacket and boots.
If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a t-shirt and shorts.
If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a light jacket and rain boots.
